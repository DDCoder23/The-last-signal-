# 🔎 Finding an Issue

The best way to start contributing is to look through the **open GitHub Issues**.

Issues may cover different difficulty levels and areas of the project.

Look for issues related to your skills or interests.

For example:

```text
🦀 Rust
🐍 Python
🌐 Networking
🧪 Testing
🔐 Security
⚙️ CI/CD
📚 Documentation
🎨 Art
```

If an issue interests you, you can comment on it before starting work.

For larger changes, discussing the approach first can help avoid duplicated or unnecessary work.

---

# 🛠 Development Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DDCoder23/The-last-signal-.git
cd The-last-signal-
```

Then install the dependencies required for the part of the project you want to work on.

### Python

The Python client is located in:

```text
client_python/
```

Python dependencies may be required depending on the component being developed.

### Rust

The Rust server is located in:

```text
server_rust/
```

Cargo is used to manage the Rust project.

For example:

```bash
cd server_rust
cargo build
```

---

# 🌿 Git Workflow

Please use a dedicated branch for each contribution.

Do **not** develop directly on `main`.

A typical workflow is:

```text
main
  │
  └── feature/my-change
          │
          ├── changes
          ├── tests
          └── Pull Request
                  │
                  ↓
                main
```

Create a branch from an up-to-date `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/my-change
```

Use a descriptive branch name.

Examples:

```text
feature/network-tests
feature/python-login
feature/rust-packet-parser
fix/login-error
fix/packet-validation
docs/update-architecture
docs/improve-contributing
test/network-protocol
ci/improve-build
```

---

# 💻 Making Changes

Keep changes focused.

A Pull Request should preferably solve **one problem or implement one coherent feature**.

Avoid mixing unrelated changes into the same PR.

For example, avoid a PR that simultaneously:

* changes the network protocol;
* rewrites unrelated Python code;
* modifies the CI;
* changes documentation;
* and reformats the entire repository.

Smaller PRs are easier to review, test, and merge. 👍

---

# 🧪 Testing Your Changes

Before opening a Pull Request, test the changes locally whenever possible.

### Rust

From `server_rust/`:

```bash
cargo test
```

You should also make sure that the project still builds:

```bash
cargo build
```

### Python

Run the relevant Python tests available in the repository.

For example:

```bash
pytest
```

If your change affects both the Python client and Rust server, test both sides when possible.

---

# 📝 Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages that describe the change.

Good examples:

```text
Add network packet tests
Fix login packet parsing
Improve Rust network handler tests
Add Python client packet validation
Update architecture documentation
Fix CI report generation
```

Avoid vague messages such as:

```text
update
fix
changes
stuff
test
```

A commit should give another developer a reasonable idea of what changed.

---

# 🔄 Keeping Your Branch Updated
